## Troubleshooting

### "Battery Monitor is damaged and can't be opened" error

This is a normal macOS security feature (Gatekeeper) because the app
is not notarized by Apple.

**Solution:**
- Use **Method 1** from the installation steps above
  (Right-click â†’ Open)
- Or use Terminal: `xattr -cr /Applications/BatteryMonitor.app`

This is safe - the app is open source and built from verified GitHub
Actions.

### "App is from an unidentified developer" warning

This is expected. The app is not signed with an Apple Developer ID
certificate.

**Solution:**
- Right-click the app and choose **Open**
- Click **Open** in the security dialog
- The app will open normally after this first time

### App won't open (other reasons)
- Go to **System Settings â†’ Privacy & Security**
- Look for a message about Battery Monitor
- Click **Open Anyway** if prompted

### Menu bar icon not showing
- Make sure you have menu bar space available
- Try quitting and relaunching the app
- Check if the icon is hidden in the menu bar overflow (Â»)

### Permission issues
- The app requires no special permissions for basic features
- All battery data is read from public macOS APIs
- No sudo or administrator access needed
